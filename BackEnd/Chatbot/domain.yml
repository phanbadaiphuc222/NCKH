  utter_about_c:
  - text: "C is a general-purpose computer programming language.
   It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential."

  utter_integer:
  - text: "• Integer data type allows a variable to store numeric values. \n• “int”\
      \ keyword is used to refer integer data type. • The storage size of int data\
      \ type is 2 or 4 or 8 byte. \n• It varies depend upon the processor in the CPU\
      \ that we use. If we are using 16 bit processor, 2 byte  (16 bit) of memory\
      \ will be allocated for int data type \n• Like wise, 4 byte (32 bit) of memory\
      \ for 32 bit processor and 8 byte (64 bit) of memory for 64 bit  allocated for\
      \ int datatype. \n• int (2 byte) can store values from -32,768 to +32,767\n\
      \ • int (4 byte) can store values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. \n\
      • If you want to use the integer value that crosses the above limit, you can\
      \ go for “long int” and “long long int” for which the limits are very high.\
      \ \n• Note:-\n • We can’t store decimal values using int data type.\n • If we\
      \ use int data type to store decimal values, decimal values will be truncated\
      \ and we will get only whole number.\n • In this case, float data type can be\
      \ used to store decimal values in a variable."

  utter_semantic_error:
  - text: "Semantic errors are the errors that occurred when the statements are not\
      \ understandable by the compiler. The following can be the cases for the semantic\
      \ error: 1] Use of a un-initialized variable.\n    int i;\n    i=i+2;\n2] Type\
      \ compatibility\n    int b = 'javatpoint';\n3] Errors in expressions\n    int\

  utter_float:
  - text: "The FLOAT data type stores double-precision floating-point numbers \n
      with up to 17 significant digits. FLOAT corresponds to IEEE 4-byte floating-point,\n
      and to the double data type in C. The range of values for the FLOAT data type is the \n
      same as the range of the C double data type on your computer"
  
  utter_programming:
  - text: "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a
      computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer
      programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++."
  
  utter_datatype:
  - text: "C language has following data types. Int Represent the number (integer)
      Float Number with a fraction part. Double Double-precision floating-point
      value Char Single character. Void Special purpose type without
      any value. The image will give you the complete picture"
  
  utter_variable:
  - text: "• C variable is a named location in a memory where a program can manipulate\
      \ the data.\n • This location is used to hold the value of the variable.\n •\

    text: "• Loop control statements in C are used to perform looping operations until
      the given condition is true.  • Control comes out of the loop statements once
      condition becomes false.  • There are 3 types of loop control statements in
      C language. They are:- for, while, do-while  • Know the flow chart here:-"

  utter_for_loop:
  - text: • For loop is used to execute\
      \ a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.\
      \ \n• We can say it is an open ended loop.\n• In for loop we have exactly two\
      \ semicolons, one after initialization and second after the condition. \n• In\
      \ this loop we can have more than one initialization or increment/decrement,\
      \ separated using comma operator. But it can have only one condition. \n• The\
      \ for loop is executed as follows:-\n    - It first evaluates the initialization\
      \ code.\n    - Then it checks the condition expression.\n    - If it is true,\
      \ it executes the for-loop body.\n    - Then it evaluate the increment/decrement\
      \ condition and again follows from step 2.\n    - When the condition expression\
      \ becomes false, it exits the loop."

  utter_while_loop:
  - text: "While loop is one of the loop statement in C which allows people to repeat their commands\n
      . The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true."

  utter_switch_case:

    text: "• Above image shall give synatx of switch case. \n • The switch statement\
      \ allows us to execute one code block among many alternatives.\nYou can do the\
      \ same thing with the if...else..if ladder. However, the syntax of the switch\
      \ statement is much easier to read and write.  "

  utter_runtime_error:
  - text: "Sometimes the errors exist during the execution-time even after the successful\
      \ compilation known as run-time errors.\nWhen the program is running, and it\
      \ is not able to perform the operation is the main cause of the run-time error.\n\
      The division by zero is the common example of the run-time error.\nThese errors\
      \ are very difficult to find, as the compiler does not point to these errors."

  utter_error:
  - text: "Errors are the problems or the faults that occur in the program, which
      makes the behavior of the program abnormal, and experienced developers can also
      make these faults. Programming errors are also known as the bugs or faults,
      and the process of removing these bugs is known as debugging. These errors are
      detected either during the time of compilation or execution. Thus, the errors
      must be removed from the program for the successful execution of the program.
      There are mainly five types of errors exist in C programming: 1]  Syntax error
      2] Run-time error 3]  Linker error 4]  Logical error 5]  Semantic error"

  utter_syntax_error:
  - text: "Syntax errors are also known as the compilation errors as they occurred\
      \ at the compilation time, or we can say that the syntax errors are thrown by\
      \ the compilers. These errors are mainly occurred due to the mistakes while\
      \ typing or do not follow the syntax of the specified programming language.\
      \ These mistakes are generally made by beginners only because they are new to\
      \ the language. These errors can be easily debugged or corrected.  For example:\
      \ If we want to declare the variable of type integer,\n    int a; // this is\
      \ the correct form\n    Int a; // this is an incorrect form.\nCommonly occurred\
      \ syntax errors are: 1] If we miss the parenthesis while writing the code.\
      \ 2] Displaying the value of a variable without its declaration. 3] If we miss\
      \ the semicolon (;) at the end of the statement."

  utter_break:
  - text: "• Sometimes, while executing a loop, it becomes necessary to skip a part\
      \ of the loop or to leave the loop as soon as certain condition becomes true.\
      \ This is known as jumping out of loop. 1) break statement:\n    When break\
      \ statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately exited and\
      \ the program continues with the statement immediately following the loop.\n"

  utter_do_while_loop:
  - text: "• The image shall give synatx of while loop. \n• In some situations it\
      \ is necessary to execute body of the loop before testing the condition. \n\
      • Such situations can be handled with the help of do-while loop. do statement\
      \ evaluates the body of the loop first and at the end, the condition is checked\
      \ using while statement. \n•It means that the body of the loop will be executed\
      \ at least once, even though the starting condition inside while is initialized\
      \ to be false."

  utter_logical_error:
  - text: "The logical error is an error that leads to an undesired output.   These
      errors produce the incorrect output, but they are error-free, known as logical
      errors.  These types of mistakes are mainly done by beginners. The occurrence
      of these errors mainly depends upon the logical thinking of the developer.   If
      the programmers sound logically good, then there will be fewer chances of these
      errors."
    
  utter_linker_error:
  - text: "Linker errors are mainly generated when the executable file of the program
      is not created.  This can be happened either due to the wrong function prototyping
      or usage of the wrong header file.  For example, the main.c file contains the
      sub() function whose declaration and definition is done in some other file such
      as func.c.  During the compilation, the compiler finds the sub() function in
      func.c file, so it generates two object files, i.e., main.o and func.o.  At
      the execution time, if the definition of sub() function is not found in the
      func.o file, then the linker error will be thrown.  The most common linker error
      that occurs is that we use Main() instead of main()."

  utter_identifier:
  - text: "In C language identifiers are the names given to variables, constants,\
      \ functions and user-define data. These identifier are defined against a set\
      \ of rules.\n* Rules for an Identifier\n    - An Identifier can only have alphanumeric\
      \ characters(a-z , A-Z , 0-9) and underscore(_).\n    - The first character\
      \ of an identifier can only contain alphabet(a-z , A-Z) or underscore (_).\n\
      \    - Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. For example name and Name are\
      \ two different identifiers in C.\n    - Keywords are not allowed to be used\
      \ as Identifiers.\n    - No special characters, such as semicolon, period, whitespaces,\
      \ slash or comma are permitted to be used in or as Identifier."

  utter_reserved_word:
  - text: "In C, we have 32 keywords, which have their predefined meaning and cannot
      be used as a variable name. These words are also known as “reserved words”.
      It is good practice to avoid using these keywords as variable name. ex.:- auto,
      int, float, char, if, else, for, while, struct, union, enum, etc"

  utter_operators:
  - text: "- C language supports a rich set of built-in operators. An operator is\
      \ a symbol that tells the compiler to perform a certain mathematical or logical\
      \ manipulation. - Operators are used in programs to manipulate data and variables.\
      \ - C operators can be classified into following types:\n    - Arithmetic operators\
      \ , Relational operators , Logical operators , Bitwise operators, Assignment\
      \ operators, Conditional operators, Special operators"

  utter_conditional_operators:
  - text: "The conditional operators in C language are known by two more names \n\
      1] Ternary Operator  \n2]  ? : Operator\nIt is actually the if condition that\
      \ we use in C language decision making, but using conditional operator, we turn\
      \ the if condition statement into a short and simple operator. The syntax of\
      \ a conditional operator is :\n    expression 1 ? expression 2: expression 3\n\
      Explanation:\n    - The question mark '?' in the syntax represents the if part.\n\
      \    - The first expression (expression 1) generally returns either true or\
      \ false, based on which it is decided whether (expression 2) will be executed\
      \ or (expression 3)\n    - If (expression 1) returns true then the expression\
      \ on the left side of ' : ' i.e (expression 2) is executed.\n    - If (expression\
      \ 1) returns false then the expression on the right side of ' : ' i.e (expression\
      \ 3) is executed."
